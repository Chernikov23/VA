## VA (Voice Assistant)
**VA** - project made by a Russian developer-amateur-schoolboy with the nickname chernikov23. The project is a simple realization of a voice assistant. So far, the problem with the assistant is that it works well only on macOS. 

In the future it is planned to realize normal work of the assistant on Windows.

*Also, the next goal for the development of this assistant is to create a separate program for macOS / Windows, so that it works in the background and does something.*

**IMPORTANT**
In order for the assistant to answer various questions, you need to get an API key for GigaChat and enter it in the field: 
`credentials = 'ENterYourApiKeyHere'`


If you have any questions about this project you can write in Telegram. Nickname: **chernikov23**
